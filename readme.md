# Intro 

this is a document similarity checker I made out of curiosity about how the plaigrism checker works but in the end I knew they don't work how I thought they work. So here is what I coded. 😁

## line_similarity.py

this file takes two strings as an argument and will tell you the similarity between them...

```javascript
python line_similarity -l1 "this is line number one" -l2 "this is line number two"
```
for example the similarity between these two lines 
> Indeed, Iran should be put on notice that efforts to try to remake Iraq in their image will be aggressively put down" he said.

> Iran should be on notice that attempts to remake Iraq in Iran\'s image will be aggressively put down, he said

is 97.53%

working on document similarity to work with document files such as .docx will update soon....
